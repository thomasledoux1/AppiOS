# AppiOS
iOS app made for Native Apps II : apps for iOS at Hogeschool Gent.\n
Project by Thomas Ledoux.
The app is a combination of a Todo-list and a movie rating part.
The todos are presented in a table view and have a location added to them (MapKit), a date (picked in calendar), a rating and a name.
It is possible to sort the todos on each one of these field (location, date, rating or name).
The movies are presented in a collection view and have a photo, rating and name.
When you add a movie or todo in the app, this is stored in the database, so you all the data is persisted.
