# AppiOS
iOS made for Native Apps II : apps for iOS at Hogeschool Gent.
Project by Thomas Ledoux.
The app is a combination of a Todo-list and a movie rating part.
The todos are presented in a table view and have a location added to them (MapKit), a date (picked in calendar), a rating and a name.
The movies are presented in a collection view and have a photo, rating and name.
