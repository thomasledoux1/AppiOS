# AppiOS
<h1>iOS app made for Native Apps II : apps for iOS at Hogeschool Gent.</h1></br>
Project by **Thomas Ledoux**.</br>
The app is a combination of a **Todo-list and a movie rating** part.</br>
The todos are presented in a **table view** and have a **location** added to them (*MapKit*), a **date** (picked in calendar), a **rating** and a **name**.</br>
It is possible to **sort** the todos on each one of these field (location, date, rating or name).</br>
The movies are presented in a **collection view** and have a **photo, rating and name**.</br>
When you add a movie or todo in the app, this is stored in the **database**, so you all the data is persisted. </br>
